# ModelDB: A system to manage ML models
**Website**: [http://modeldb.csail.mit.edu](http://modeldb.csail.mit.edu)

ModelDB is an end-to-end system to manage machine learning models. It can ingest models and metadata as they are built, store this data in a structured format, and surface it through a web-frontend for rich querying.

## Setup

ModelDB currently works with machine learning worklows in ```spark.ml``` and ```scikit-learn```.
- Getting Started Guide for [spark.ml](https://github.com/mitdbg/modeldb/blob/master/docs/getting_started/spark_ml.md)
- Getting Started Guide for [scikit-learn](https://github.com/mitdbg/modeldb/blob/master/docs/getting_started/scikit_learn.md)

These guides include instructions on setup, building ModelDB, and incorporating ModelDB into ML workflows. Start there!
