Real-time Model Monitoring
==========================

Once a model is deployed, close monitoring is required, both at the systems level  (e.g. CPU,
memory, network) as well as the feature and data level to ensure that the model is performing 
at the highest levels and rapidly remedy production incidents.

Verta's model monitoring provides both system and data monitoring to ensure real-time model
health. 
Note that this functionality is only available for hosted versions of Verta.
